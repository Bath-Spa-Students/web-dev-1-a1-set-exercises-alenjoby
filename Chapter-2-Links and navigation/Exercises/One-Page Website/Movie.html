            <!--Overview Section-->
            <p>With the tranquil Konkan shoreline as a backdrop, "Sapta Sagaradaache Ello: Side A" depicts a picture of escape and emotional reckoning.
                Manu, a good-hearted but obviously tormented man who left his middle-class life behind in search of a new beginning, is introduced to us.
                The serene oceanic environment, accentuated by the soothing  blue color scheme, contrasts sharply with the possible chaos alluded to by Side B's red motif.
                Manu meets priya here, a college student who longs to live near the sea. As their relationship grows, Manu gets a taste of happiness and motivation to previous decisions loom large.

                We get to see hints of their internal conflicts and the outside forces that could upset their recently discovered peace.
                Viewers are curious to watch how Manu and Priya handle the obstacles that lie ahead in Side B and whether Manu can really overcome the ghost
                of his past after Side A ends with a sense of hope mixed with Questions.

                <p>As Per my opinion, this was one of the best movies I have seen recently, The lead roles(Manu) and (Priya) was not acting the charactes,
                    The efforts they both put into the relationship should be noticed. Not only the movie is succesful in it's acting part, but also in the technical side too.
                    they music is just soulfull. Charan Raj has created magic with music that blends so well with the movie.
                    Hats off to the Director Hemanth Rao.
                    <br><br>
                    It's an ocean all by itself overall. and when I say ocean, I mean how the movie stays with you long after
                    you leave the theatre and not just what you see on screen. It becomes more profound and improved the more you think it.
                    I have to admit that this movie wil stick with me longer than I had anticipated.
                    they were just living the characters. The way they potrayed those characters makes us fall in love with them.
