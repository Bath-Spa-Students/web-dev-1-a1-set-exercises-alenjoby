            <p>As Per my opinion, this was one of the best movies I have seen recently, The lead roles(Manu) and (Priya) was not acting the charactes,
               The efforts they both put into the relationship should be noticed. Not only the movie is succesful in it's acting part, but also in the technical side too.
               they music is just soulfull. Charan Raj has created magic with music that blends so well with the movie.
               Hats off to the Director Hemanth Rao.

               It's an ocean all by itself overall. and when I say ocean, I mean how the movie stays with you long after
               you leave the theatre and not just what you see on screen. It becomes more profound and improved the more you think it.
               I have to admit that this movie wil stick with me longer than I had anticipated.
               they were just living the characters. The way they potrayed those characters makes us fall in love with them.
