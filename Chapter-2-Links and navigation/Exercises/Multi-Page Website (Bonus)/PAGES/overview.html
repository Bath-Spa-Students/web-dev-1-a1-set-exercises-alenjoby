       <!--Overview Section-->
       <p>With the tranquil Konkan shoreline as a backdrop, "Sapta Sagaradaache Ello: Side A" depicts a picture of escape and emotional reckoning.
          Manu, a good-hearted but obviously tormented man who left his middle-class life behind in search of a new beginning, is introduced to us.
          The serene oceanic environment, accentuated by the soothing  blue color scheme, contrasts sharply with the possible chaos alluded to by Side B's red motif.
          Manu meets priya here, a college student who longs to live near the sea. As their relationship grows, Manu gets a taste of happiness and motivation to previous decisions loom large  
          We get to see hints of their internal conflicts and the outside forces that could upset their recently discovered peace.
          Viewers are curious to watch how Manu and Priya handle the obstacles that lie ahead in Side B and whether Manu can really overcome the ghost
          of his past after Side A ends with a sense of hope mixed with Questions.
